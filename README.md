WebApp project work

To get the project running you should first type "npm install" in the root folder. This install all the needed packages to front- and backend.

You also need mongodb to run this program
which you can download from here:https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

To start the server you can type "npm run dev" which starts front- and backend.
Frontend runs on localhost:3000 and backend on localhost:5000.

This project allows user to register, login, to post code snippets and comment already made posts. On the front page theres to option to register, login and list of all the posts made. If the user is loged in theres also an option to make a post and the login option is hidden for logged users. By clicking a post you can also see all the comments on that post and if logged in make a comment yourself. 

Code is moustly expended from already made stuff on the course especially from the weeks 7 and 11 (source code for these:
 wk7: https://version.lab.fi/Erno.Vanhala/web-applications-week-7
 wk11:https://version.lab.fi/Erno.Vanhala/web-applications-week-11 ). Frontend uses React, backend uses node/express and as database i am using mongodb via mongoose.

 Features
 All the needed basic features and frontside is made with react, so i am aiming for 30 points here.
